They few talks we have had have help me a bunch and I look forward to many more! In my family we have a very corny \"traditional\" song that we add to the end of the birthday song. We start the song with \"and many more\" and end with \"and lots and lots of fun\"(with jazz hands). It doesn't have the same magic not hearing the song, but from me to you, I wish you many more birthdays and as much fun as you heart can handle. Happy birthday, Aethy!",
